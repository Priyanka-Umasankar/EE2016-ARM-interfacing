# ARM Interfacing - LED and DIP Switch Interaction

This repository contains multiple programs for interfacing with LPC2148 ARM microcontroller to control LEDs and interact with a DIP switch.

## Programs:

The repository includes four distinct programs:

### 1. **Hexadecimal Number Display on LEDs**
   - This program reads a hexadecimal number and displays it on a set of LEDs.

### 2. **DIP Switch Input to LEDs**
   - This program reads the value from a DIP switch and displays the corresponding number on LEDs.

### 3. **Sum of Two Nibbles from DIP Switch**
   - This program reads two nibbles (4-bit values) from the DIP switch, adds them together, and displays the sum on the LEDs.

### 4. **Product of Two Nibbles from DIP Switch**
   - This program reads two 4-bit nibbles from the DIP switch, calculates their product, and displays the result on the LEDs.
